# ReferenceArchitectureAndroid
This project will be used a sample reference for future projects on the best coding practices for Android. It will use the [MVVM](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-3-model-view-viewmodel-e7eeee76b73b) architecture along with other best practices such as [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [Navigation Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/), [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) and more.
